# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode coding questions. I have solved these questions as part of my practice and learning journey in programming and algorithms.

Each solution is implemented in Java/JavaScript and categorized based on the question's difficulty level. I use the LeetHub extension to automatically save my solutions to this repository from the LeetCode platform.


Each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) has its own directory containing Java/JavaScript files with solutions to different LeetCode questions.

## How to Use
